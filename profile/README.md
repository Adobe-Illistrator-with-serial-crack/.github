Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed by Adobe Systems. Itâ€™s used primarily for creating illustrations, logos, icons, typography, and other graphic design elements.

Typography: Illustrator excels in working with text, offering tools to manipulate and stylize type, including converting text to outlines for more complex design work.

Color & Gradient Options: Illustrator has a wide range of color tools, including the ability to work with Pantone colors, create custom color palettes, and apply gradients to vector objects.

Artboards: Multiple artboards can be used within a single document, making it easier to work on multiple versions of a design or create design systems.

Integration with Other Adobe Software: Illustrator integrates seamlessly with other Adobe Creative Cloud applications like Photoshop, InDesign, and After Effects, allowing for a smooth workflow across different types of projects.

Creative Cloud Libraries: With Adobe Creative Cloud, users can store assets (like colors, graphics, brushes, and styles) in libraries for easy access across various applications.
